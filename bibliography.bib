abstract = {In assembly lines, deformation of the objects makes many efforts on automating the corresponding processes difficult. Mating of a wire harness onto a car body is among the representative tasks. Academically, this kind of problems are known as automatic manipulation of deformable linear objects. Previous technical approaches for solving the problem is characterized by employment of multiple contactless sensors and complex sensor based algorithms. These attempts are verified to be feasible only for simplified environments. The dependence of the approaches on real-time measurement to the state of the deformable targets limits their application in practical factory environment. In this paper, it is proposed to utilize wire tracing operation in recognizing the wire harness for the purpose of automatic mating. This method is inspired from the behaviors of humans demonstrated when they deal with similar problems. The proposed method is implemented and verified in a robot system. The feasibility and effectiveness demonstrated in the preliminary experiments show the potential of the proposed method for substantially simplifying the wire recognition problems which is thought to be crucial for practices in factory environments.}

abstract = { Manipulating deformable objects is a challenging task for robots. The major difficulty 
lies in how to track these objects accurately, robustly, and efficiently, considering they have infinite-dimensional configuration space. 
To deal with these problems, this paper proposes a novel state estimator to track deformable objects from point clouds. A non-rigid registration method, 
named structure preserved registration (SPR), is developed to update the estimation by registering the object model towards the current point cloud measurement.
Both the local structure and the global topology of the deformable object are considered during registration, which improves the estimation robustness under noise,
outliers, and occlusions. The tracking result is further refined by running a dynamic simulation in parallel, which enforces the estimates to satisfy the physical 
constraints of the object. A series of real-time tracking experiments on 1D objects (ropes) and 2D objects (clothes) are performed to evaluate the proposed state estimator.
A wire harness manipulation platform is also introduced where robots can manipulate soft wires to desired shapes and autonomously evaluate the manipulation quality through visual feedback. }

In spite of the good performance, the representation has a few issues in nature, such as non-differentiable post-processing and quantization error.

It is differentiable, efficient, and compatible with any heat map based methods. Its effectiveness is convincingly validated via comprehensive ablation experiments under various settings, specifically on 3D pose estimation, for the first time.",

abstract="There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.",

abstract = {Feature pyramids are a basic component in recognition systems for detecting objects at different scales. But pyramid representations have been avoided in recent object detectors that are based on deep convolutional networks, partially because they are slow to compute and memory intensive. In this paper, we exploit the inherent multi-scale, pyramidal hierarchy of deep convolutional networks to construct feature pyramids with marginal extra cost. A top-down architecture with lateral connections is developed for building high-level semantic feature maps at all scales. This architecture, called a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), shows significant improvement as a generic feature extractor in several applications. Using a basic Faster R-CNN system, our method achieves state-of-the-art single-model results on the COCO detection benchmark without bells and whistles, surpassing all existing single-model entries including those from the COCO 2016 challenge winners. In addition, our method can run at 5 FPS on a GPU and thus is a practical and accurate solution to multi-scale object detection. Code will be made publicly available.},

abstract="Spatial pyramid pooling module or encode-decoder structure are used in deep neural networks for semantic segmentation task. The former networks are able to encode multi-scale contextual information by probing the incoming features with filters or pooling operations at multiple rates and multiple effective fields-of-view, while the latter networks can capture sharper object boundaries by gradually recovering the spatial information. In this work, we propose to combine the advantages from both methods. Specifically, our proposed model, DeepLabv3+, extends DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module to refine the segmentation results especially along object boundaries. We further explore the Xception model and apply the depthwise separable convolution to both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder modules, resulting in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, achieving the test set performance of 89{\%} and 82.1{\%} without any post-processing.

abstract = {This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer.},

abstract="While robotic manipulation of rigid objects is quite straightforward, coping with deformable objects is an open issue. More specifically, tasks like tying a knot, wiring a connector or even surgical suturing deal with the domain of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs). In particular the detection of a DLO is a non-trivial problem especially under clutter and occlusions (as well as self-occlusions). The pose estimation of a DLO results into the identification of its parameters related to a designed model, e.g. a basis spline. It follows that the stand-alone segmentation of a DLO might not be sufficient to conduct a full manipulation task. This is why we propose a novel framework able to perform both a semantic segmentation and b-spline modeling of multiple deformable linear objects simultaneously without strict requirements about environment (i.e. the background). The core algorithm is based on biased random walks over the Region Adiacency Graph built on a superpixel oversegmentation of the source image. The algorithm is initialized by a Convolutional Neural Networks that detects the DLO's endcaps. An open source implementation of the proposed approach is also provided to easy the reproduction of the whole detection pipeline along with a novel cables dataset in order to encourage further experiments.",

abstract = {Automating stages for deformable objects in the production line, such as assembling a wire harness into a predefined position, presents a complex task due to the specialized characteristics of these objects. This complexity is further magnified when dealing with a wire harness that has multiple branches. Designing the robot motions and performing the assembly tasks for such target objects not only requires the 3D wire profile of each branch but also entails the identification of each branch. To satisfy this requirement, this study introduces a novel systematic method that processes the point cloud data of the wire harness, captured from a high-quality 3D camera, which provides the constructed wire profiles of branches in the captured frames. The developed method is a combination of a technique to classify the colour of wires and a detecting-matching method to identify the wire terminals, which provides a convenient approach for the proposed tracking method to define the 3D wire profile. The validation of the proposed approach in a real-world robot system not only highlights its incredible usefulness but also demonstrates its immense practicality. This ground-breaking method has the potential to revolutionize factory environments by replacing human labour, leading to substantial cost reductions and increased efficiency.}

abstract="Wire harness installation is one of the most challenging processing steps for automation in automotive production. Wire harnesses have an infinite number of degrees of freedom, such that they change their shape continuously during manipulation. As of today, the human's ability to perceive the wire harness and deal with its shape changes, is unmatched by any technical solution. Therefore, wire harnesses are still installed manually. This paper proposes a concept for wire harness localization and applies it for robotic wire harness installation. The concept uses two stereo cameras, one to perceive the shape of the wire harness and obtain rough position estimates of wire harness components, and a second for accurate 6D pose estimation of the individual components. The concept is evaluated with a case study on localization in a car chassis, where the accuracy and limitations of the concept are investigated by practical experiments.",

Though current techniques have achieved great success, it is noteworthy that in many tasks it is difficult to get strong supervision information like fully ground-truth labels due to the high cost of the data-labeling process. Thus, it is desirable for machine-learning techniques to work with weak supervision. This article reviews some research progress of weakly supervised learning, focusing on three typical types of weak supervision: incomplete supervision, where only a subset of training data is given with labels; inexact supervision, where the training data are given with only coarse-grained labels; and inaccurate supervision, where the given labels are not always ground-truth.}",
